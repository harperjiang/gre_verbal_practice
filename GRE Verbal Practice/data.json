Given a fair chance, I repeat; for the fair chance is an indispensable prerequisite. No people that pass abruptly from a state of subservience under the rule of a despot to the completely unfamiliar state of political independence can be said to have a fair chance of being able to govern itself democratically.

It is worth noticing that the dislike of Dickens implied in this anecdote is something unusual. Plenty of people have found him unreadable, but very few seem to have felt any hostility towards the general spirit of his work. Some years later, Bechhofer Roberts published a full-length attack on Dickens in the form of a novel, but it was a merely personal attack, concerned for the most part with Dickens’s treatment of his wife. It dealt with incidents which not one in a thousand of Dickens’s readers would ever hear about, and which no more invalidates his work than the second-best bed invalidates Hamlet. All that the book really demonstrated was that a writer’s literary personality has little or nothing to do with his private character.\n\nIt is quite possible that in private life Dickens was just the kind of insensitive egoist that Bechhofer Roberts makes him appear. But in his published work there is implied a personality quite different from this, a personality which has won him far more friends than enemies. It might well have been otherwise, for even if Dickens was a bourgeois, he was certainly a subversive writer, a radical, one might truthfully say a rebel. Everyone who has read widely in his work has felt this. Gissing, for instance, the best of the writers on Dickens, was anything but a radical himself, and he disapproved of this strain in Dickens and wished it were not there, but it never occurred to him to deny it. In Oliver Twist, Hard Times, Bleak House, Little Dorrit, Dickens attacked English institutions with a ferocity that has never since been approached. Yet he managed to do it without making himself hated, and, more than this, the very people he attacked have swallowed him so completely that he has become a national institution himself. In its attitude towards Dickens the English public has always been a little like the elephant which feels a blow with a walking-stick as a delightful tickling. Before I was ten years old I was having Dickens ladled down my throat by schoolmasters in whom even at that age I could see a strong resemblance to Mr. Creakle, and one knows without needing to be told that lawyers delight in Sergeant Buzfuz and that Little Dorrit is a favourite in the Home Office.

The second paragraph critiques a study of Douglass’ career by Waldo Martin and claims that Martin has failed to offer a “convincing rebuttal to those critics who dismiss Douglass’ ideology as a relic of the past” (lines 30–31). This indicates that Choice E is correct.","readText":"Frederick Douglass was unquestionably the most famous African American of the nineteenth century; indeed when he died in 1895 he was among the most distinguished public figures in the United States. In his study of Douglass’ career as a major figure in the movement to abolish slavery and as a spokesman for Black rights, Waldo Martin has provoked controversy by contending that Douglass also deserves a prominent place in the intellectual history of the United States because he exemplified so many strands of nineteenth-century thought: romanticism, idealism, individualism, liberal humanism, and an unshakable belief in progress. But this very argument provides ammunition for those who claim that most of Douglass’ ideas, being so representative of their time, are now obsolete. Douglass’ vision of the future as a melting pot in which all racial and ethnic differences would dissolve into “a composite American nationality” appears from the pluralist perspective of many present-day intellectuals to be not only utopian but even wrongheaded. Yet there is a central aspect of Douglass’ thought that seems not in the least bit dated or irrelevant to current concerns. He has no rival in the history of the nineteenth-century United States as an insistent and effective critic of the doctrine of innate racial inequality. He not only attacked racist ideas in his speeches and writings, but he offered his entire career and all his achievements as living proof that racists were wrong in their belief that one race could be inherently superior to another. While Martin stresses Douglass’ antiracist egalitarianism, he does not adequately explain how this aspect of Douglass’ thought fits in with his espousal of the liberal Victorian attitudes that many present-day intellectuals consider to be naïve and outdated. The fact is that Douglass was attracted to these democratic-capitalist ideals of his time because they could be used to attack slavery and the doctrine of White supremacy. His favorite rhetorical strategy was to expose the hypocrisy of those who, while professing adherence to the ideals of democracy and equality of opportunity, condoned slavery and racial discrimination. It would have been strange indeed if he had not embraced liberal idealism, because it proved its worth for the cause of racial equality during the national crisis that eventually resulted in emancipation and citizenship for African Americans. These points may seem obvious, but had Martin given them more attention, his analysis might have constituted a more convincing rebuttal to those critics who dismiss Douglass’ ideology as a relic of the past.

Most spiral-shaped snail species are predominantly dextral. But at one time, handedness (twist direction of the shell) was equally distributed within some snail species that have become predominantly dextral or, in a few species, predominantly sinistral. What mechanisms control handedness and keep left-handedness rare? It would seem unlikely that evolution should discriminate against sinistral snails if sinistral and dextral snails are exact mirror images, for any disadvantage that a sinistral twist in itself could confer on its possessor is almost inconceivable. But left- and right-handed snails are not actually true mirror images of one another. Their shapes are noticeably different. Sinistral rarity might, then, be a consequence of possible disadvantages conferred by these other concomitant structural features. In addition, perhaps left- and right-handed snails cannot mate with each other, having incompatible twist directions. Presumably an individual of the rarer form would have relative difficulty in finding a mate of the same hand, thus keeping the rare form rare or creating geographically separated right- and left-handed populations. But this evolutionary mechanism combining dissymmetry, anatomy, and chance does not provide an adequate explanation of why right-handedness should have become predominant. It does not explain, for example, why the infrequent unions between snails of opposing hands produce fewer offspring of the rarer than the commoner form in species where each parent contributes equally to handedness. Nor does it explain why, in a species where one parent determines handedness, a brood is not exclusively right- or left-handed when the offspring would have the same genetic predisposition. In the European pond snail Lymnaea peregra, a predominantly dextral species whose handedness is maternally determined, a brood might be expected to be exclusively right- or left-handed—and this often occurs. However, some broods possess a few snails of the opposing hand, and in predominantly sinistral broods, the incidence of dextrality is surprisingly high. Here, the evolutionary theory must defer to a theory based on an explicit developmental mechanism that can favor either right- or left-handedness. In the case of Lymnaea peregra, studies indicate that a dextral gene is expressed during egg formation; i.e., before egg fertilization, the gene produces a protein, found in the cytoplasm of the egg, that controls the pattern of cell division and thus handedness. In experiments, an injection of cytoplasm from dextral eggs changes the pattern of sinistral eggs, but an injection from sinistral eggs does not influence dextral eggs. One explanation for the differing effects is that all Lymnaea peregra eggs begin left-handed but most switch to being right-handed. Thus the path to a solution to the puzzle of handedness in all snails appears to be as twisted as the helix itself.","multiple":false,"selectSentence":false},{"uid":"cafef7de-a345-4ed9-9631-e4b96c21faba","type":2,"text":"The second paragraph of the passage is primarily concerned with offering possible reasons why","options":["it is unlikely that evolutionary mechanisms could discriminate against sinistral snails","sinistrality is relatively uncommon among snail species","dextral and sinistral populations of a snail species tend to intermingle","a theory based on a developmental mechanism inadequately accounts for the predominance of dextrality across snail species","dextral snails breed more readily than sinistral snails, even within predominantly sinistral populations"],"answers":[1],"explanation":"The first paragraph ends with the question “What mechanisms control handedness and keep left-handedness rare?” The second paragraph attempts to answer this question: perhaps, the paragraph suggests, sinistral rarity is a consequence either of natural selection working on “concomitant structural features,” or of difficulties in mating for left-handed snails.

Given this omission, it follows that data about female labor would be hard to come by, making it difficult to measure its growth; therefore “track” is the correct answer for Blank (i). As for the other choices, since the author asserts that the role of female labor has routinely been overlooked, “ignore” cannot be correct. The conjunction “yet” in the first sentence indicates that the phrase containing Blank (i) contrasts with the importance of female labor; since “overestimate” emphasizes this importance, it also cannot be correct. The second sentence places research about female labor during industrialization into the larger context of research about women; the word “despite” that begins the sentence indicates that the latter runs counter to trends in the larger field. Neither “gaps” nor “disinterest” would provide the necessary contrast between the two, since “gaps” in the larger field of research about women would mirror the omission of the role of female labor and “disinterest” would explain such omissions. \"Advances” does provide a contrast, and is thus the correct answer. In the sentence containing Blank (iii), “yet” indicates a contrast between the makeup of the workforce and the availability of data about the workforce. Because the author says that women outnumbered men in the workforce, the contrast would likely require data that mostly concerned men. Of the three choices for Blank (iii), “incorporate data only” conveys this sense. The other two options can be ruled out because of the previous sentence’s assertion that female labor is ignored by economic analyses.

Of the other two responses, “sensational”\nhas some merit, suggesting that the textbooks resort to a melodramatic presentation of historical debate; however, “factual” is the better choice, implying as it does gross inaccuracies. That the critique of the textbooks centers upon accuracy rather than tone is confirmed by the rest of the sentence, which deals with the relationship between the textbooks’ claims and the primary sources upon which historical scholarship is based. The “even” that precedes Blank (ii) calls for a word that is yet further away from factual than “hotly debated.” Of the choices, only “contradicted” fits this criterion; the other two options are the opposite of what is needed. Finally, Blank (iii) calls for a word that de-scribes the primary sources.

Since the first sentence asserts that daytime highs are increasing less rapidly than nighttime lows, Blank (ii) calls for a verb that indicates a moderation in rises in temperature during the day, and “restrain” has this sense. “Augment,” meaning to increase, has the opposite meaning, while “mask” would indicate that measurements are not reflecting actual increases in temperature, an idea not supported by the rest of the passage. The “because” in the last sentence indicates that the second clause explains how daytime temperature increases are restrained; it does so by making reference to solar energy and the evaporation of moisture. Because solar energy is responsible for increases in daytime temperature, the answer to Blank (iii) requires a word that explains how evaporation can lessen or divert that energy for other purposes. “Used up in” does this because it indicates that less solar energy is available to warm the Earth’s surface when a portion of it is instead devoted to evaporation.

The answer to Blank (ii) must be an umbrella term for things listed in the second part of the sentence as defeaters of boredom: “screen triumphs,” “interesting books,” “heroic exploits.” The answer choice that best matches this meaning is “real achievement,” so it is correct. “Competing attraction” also seems a plausible choice for Blank (ii), but it is incorrect because the sentence does not mention competition between attractions.\nThus the correct answer is a f leeting(Choice A) and real achievement (Choice F).","readText":"","multiple":false,"selectSentence":false},{"type":3,"text":"Attheirbest,(i)____ book reviews are written indefense of value and in the tacit hope that the author, having had his or her (ii)____ pointed out, might secretly agree that the book could be improved.","options":[["abstruse","adverse","hortatory"],["strengths","transgressions","assumptions"]],"answers":[1,1],"explanation":"The second part of the sentence talks about the author agreeing that the book can be improved after the things named by Blank (ii) are pointed out; therefore, the answer to Blank (ii) must denote something negative whose presence calls for improvement.

Since “gaps” implies a concern with completeness, the characterization of that evidence that makes the most sense for Blank (ii) is “incomplete.” The other choices, “credible” or “extant,” could explain the accu-racy or verifiability of the accounts in question but nothing about the gaps themselves. Once it is determined that “incomplete” is the best choice for characterizing the evidence, it follows that the gaps in the accounts based on that evidence would likely be considerable, so the opposite of considerable, “trifling,” is the correct answer for Blank (i). \nThus the correct answer is trifling (Choice A) and incomplete (Choice F).","readText":"","multiple":false,"selectSentence":false},{"type":3,"text":"That today’s students of American culture tend to (i)____ classical music is understandable.

Since music was widely esteemed during the Gilded Age, it follows that it is viewed more negatively, or disregarded, during the current era. Of the choices for Blank (i), “ignore” is the only choice that conveys this sentiment; “promote” connotes the opposite, while “reinterpret” suggests a different sort of positive engagement with classical music that is otherwise unmentioned in the passage. The author characterizes the current disconnection between music and culture as understandable, and uses pejorative language (“degenerated,” “formulaic”) to describe current classical music. Of the three choices for Blank (ii), “sacrifice” best conveys this dismissive attitude; “appreciate” would convey that those who forego orchestral concerts are indeed missing something worthwhile, while “malign” overstates the presumed level of feeling and activity of one who simply does not attend concerts. Since the lack of a connection between culture and classical music must contrast with the relationship during the Gilded Age, the answer to Blank (iii) is “centrally embedded in.” Of the other two choices, “generally rejected by” would provide no contrast, while “antagonistic toward” suggests a relationship that would not explain why music was so widely esteemed.\nThus the correct answer is ignore (Choice C), sacrifice (Choice D), and centrally embedded in (Choice I).","readText":"","multiple":false,"selectSentence":false},{"type":3,"text":"The serious study of popular culture by intellectuals is regularly credited with having rendered obsolete a once-dominant view that popular culture is inherently inferior to high art.

In the last sentence, Blank (iii) is preceded by the word “continued,” indicating that something about intellectuals’ view of the hierarchy of culture has remained unchanged. Since the author states in the first sentence that this hierarchy was once dominant, “investment in” the hierarchy would in-dicate that sense of continuity. Neither of the other two options is supported by the pas-sage because there is no indication the author believes that intellectuals have a long-held aversion to or misunderstanding of that hierarchy. The “although” that begins the last sentence indicates that the phrase completed by Blank (ii) will contrast the respectability of analyses of popular culture with something that nonetheless reveals a continued allegiance to the hierarchy. A need to explain away a “distaste for” or an “indifference to” action movies or pulp fiction would not indicate any such allegiance, so those choices must be incorrect. However, a need to justify one’s penchant or liking for popular culture would indicate an adherence to the high-low culture hierarchy. Thus “penchant for” is the correct choice for Blank (ii). Finally, since the author is suggesting that the hierarchy given to high and low culture is not obsolete as some claim, it follows that the shift in attitudes is exaggerated; thus, the correct answer to Blank (i) is “overstated.” “Underappreciated” implies the opposite, and “counterproductive” implies a judgment about the value of the hierarchy, whereas the passage is primarily concerned with its existence.\nThus the correct answer is overstated (Choice C), penchant for (Choice D), and investment in (Choice H).","readText":"","multiple":false,"selectSentence":false}]},{"name":"ETS Practice Set 2","detail":"","type":1,"difficulty":1,"questions":[{"type":1,"text":"The band’s long-standing strategy of laying leisurely explorations atop a steady funk beat has proven to be surprisingly ____: a concert in Cologne from 1972 sounds as if it could have taken place today.","options":["fortuitous","foresighted","prescient","popular","serendipitous","lucrative"],"answers":[1,2],"explanation":"The colon indicates that the second part of the sentence supports the assertion made in the first part.

Both “foresighted” and “prescient” suggest that the band’s musical strategy anticipated the trends of the coming decades, so they are the correct choice.

True, less sea ice would form in the winter because global warming would cause temperatures to rise. However, Martinson argues, the effect of a warmer atmosphere may be offset as follows. The formation of sea ice causes the concentration of salt in surface waters to increase; less sea ice would mean a smaller increase in the concentration of salt. Less salty surface waters would be less dense and therefore less likely to sink and stir up deep water. The deep water, with all its stored heat, would rise to the surface at a slower rate.

Blank (i) calls for a characterization of the relationship between the researchers and the inevitability of imperfections in printing technology.

Blank (ii) must contain a word that describes the writer’s relationship with convention; “undoing” is the only one that reflects originality. Blank (iii) likewise requires a word that conveys the novelty of the writer’s work.

The best choice would be ‘physical’ trauma to contrast with the mental trauma implied in ‘stress-induced’.","readText":""},{"type":3,"text":"The publishers, unwilling to ____ the entire risk, insisted that the author pay half the cost of the initial print run of his ____ new book.","options":[["hedge","shoulder","mitigate"],["unexceptionable","controversial","jaundiced"]],"answers":[1,1],"explanation":"The book is obviously a risk to publish and the publishers are unwilling to take all the risk. To ‘shoulder’ the risk means to bear the risk. And the book would be risky if it were ‘controversial’. Be careful to read the choices carefully as ‘unexceptionable’ means ‘cannot be objected to’ and is the opposite of what we need, but some people misunderstand it to mean ‘unacceptable’.","readText":""},{"type":3,"text":"Science advances ____ as ____ change abruptly and we are forced to stop and reorient ourselves to view old information in new ways.","options":[["exponentially","inexorably","jerkily"],["paradigms","axioms","continuities"]],"answers":[2,0],"explanation":"Since the changes are abrupt, the word ‘jerkily’ is best. Since axioms (taken as true) and continuities do not change, we are left with ‘paradigms’ (models, or ways of looking at things).","readText":""},{"type":3,"text":"The game of chess is an example of a ___ information system: the pieces sit inertly on the board until the players move them according to known rules.","options":[["interactive","passive","cybernetic","disruptive","logistic"]],"answers":[1],"explanation":"The key here is that the pieces are inert or ‘passive’.","readText":""},{"type":3,"text":"A highly intelligent person often thinks ____; a few snippets of information can trigger a ____ conclusion that might not stand up to closer, and ____, scrutiny.","options":[["too deeply","too warily","too quickly"],["firm","labored","hasty"],["slower","precipitous","overt"]],"answers":[2,2,0],"explanation":"If the conclusion might not stand up, it suggests that the conclusion was a bad one. If we select ‘hasty’ for this second blank, then it is easy to see that the thinking was done ‘too quickly’ and that ‘slower’ scrutiny would reveal the error. (Precipitous – hurried; warily – cautiously)","readText":""},{"type":3,"text":"Major philosophical ____ about morality, identity and rationality, for example, can often be ____ by thought experiments: short and simple expositions that pose an abstract and complex problem in a concrete manner with all the ____ factors removed.","options":[["certitudes","dilemmas","dogmas"],["mimicked","illuminated","evoked"],["extraneous","inherent","pivotal"]],"answers":[1,1,0],"explanation":"Since the problems posed are abstract and complex it is unlikely that we would need words like ‘dogma’ and ‘certitudes’ which would imply that the ideas are fixed. However, if we take ‘dilemmas’ (quandaries or difficult choices) then it becomes easy to see that a thought experiment might clarify (illuminate) the dilemma in a simple manner that removed all unnecessary (extraneous) factors.
